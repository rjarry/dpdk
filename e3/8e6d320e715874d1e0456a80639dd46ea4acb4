v2:

* Fixed typo in commit log: 's/agree gators/aggregators/' (thanks vim z= auto
  suggestions).

v1:

* Ideally, this script should be tested in CI to avoid breakage when the
  telemetry data structures change. I don't know where such a test could
  be done.

* There was work done 3/4 years ago in collectd to add DPDK telemetry
  support but I think this has now been abandoned.

  https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/main/src/dpdk_telemetry.c

  I think that keeping the exporters in the DPDK repository makes more
  sense from a maintainability perspective.
