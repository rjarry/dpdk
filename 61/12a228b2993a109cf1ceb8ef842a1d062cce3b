v2:

* Added __extension__ (not sure where it is needed, I don't have access to windows).
* It still fails the header check for C++. It seems not possible to align an unnamed union...
  Tyler, do you have an idea about how to fix that?
* Added static_assert to ensure the anonymous union is not larger than RTE_NODE_CTX_SZ.
