v1 -> v2:
- changed the approach based on Morten's review: the callback is now expected to
  report the total number of cycles since application start and the amount of these
  cycles that were spent doing busy work. This will give more flexibility in external
  monitoring tools to decide the sample period to compute busyness ratio.
