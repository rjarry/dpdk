v5:

* Helper functions to hide casting proved to be harder than expected.
  Naive casting may even be impossible without breaking strict aliasing
  rules. The only other option would be to use explicit memcpy calls.
* Unnamed union tentative again. As suggested by Tyler (thank you!),
  using an intermediate unnamed struct to carry the alignment produces
  consistent ABI in C and C++.

v4:

* Replaced the unnamed union with helper inline functions.

v3:

* Added __extension__ to the unnamed struct inside the union.
* Fixed C++ header checks.
* Replaced alignas() with an explicit static_assert.
