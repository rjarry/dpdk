v3 -> v4:

- Changed nomenclature: CPU cycles -> TSC cycles

v2 -> v3:

- Copied callback to local variable to guard against (unlikely) races.
- Used != NULL convention to test if callback is defined.
- Fixed typo in doc string.
- Did not add a % value in rte_lcore_dump() as its use would be very
  limited.

v1 -> v2:

Changed the approach based on Morten's review: the callback is now
expected to report the total number of cycles since application start
and the amount of these cycles that were spent doing busy work. This
will give more flexibility in external monitoring tools to decide the
sample period to compute busyness ratio.
