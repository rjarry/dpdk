v3 -> v4:

- Changed nomenclature: CPU cycles -> TSC cycles

v2 -> v3:

- Copied callback to local variable to guard against (unlikely) races.
- Used != NULL convention to test if callback is defined.
- Fixed typo in doc string.
- Did not add a % value in rte_lcore_dump() as its use would be very
  limited.
